:octocat: I am a GitHub Staff Engineer focusing on security cloud infrastructure.  My other titles include sofwtare developer, cloud security architect, instructor, curriculum author, speaker, and one-time manager.  My passion is to make new tools that others use to improve the security of their infrastructure.

:shipit: I was with the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/) for over 20 years, focus on cyber operations, red/blue/hunt, and software development.
