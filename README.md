I am a software developer,cloud security architect, instructor, and one time manager.  My passion is to make new tools for others to use.

:octocat: I am a staff engineer with [GitHub](https://github.com/) focusing on securing cloud workflows.

:shipit:	I was with the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/) for over 20 years, focus on cyber operations, red/blue/hunt, and software development.

:man_teacher: SANS Instructor

:writing_hand:	Co-author of SANS class [SEC541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring & Threat Detection](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-monitoring-threat-detection/)

🔭 I’m currently researching automated response actions, Azure policy deployment, and learning Terraform even though [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) is my favorite.
