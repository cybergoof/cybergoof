# üëã  Hi everyone, I am Shaun (cybergoof)

üì¢ I am excited to be speaking at [RSA 2024](https://www.rsaconference.com/experts/Shaun%20McCullough) in a talk titled **Building a Cloud Security Flywheel: Lessons from the Field**.  https://sec541.com/rsa will point to a blob post covering the topic of the presentation, so stay tuned.

:octocat: I am a GitHub Staff Engineer focusing on security cloud infrastructure.  My other titles include software developer, cloud security architect, instructor, curriculum author, speaker, and one-time manager.  My passion is to make new tools that others use to improve the security of their infrastructure.

:shipit: I was with the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/) for over 20 years, focus on cyber operations, red/blue/hunt, and software development.

:man_teacher: SANS Instructor

:writing_hand:	Co-author of SANS class [SEC541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring & Threat Detection](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-monitoring-threat-detection/)

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently researching automated response actions, Azure policy deployment, and learning Terraform even though [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) is my favorite.
