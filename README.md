- :writing_hand:	Co-author of SANS class [SEC541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring & Threat Detection](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-monitoring-threat-detection/)
- 🔭 I’m currently researching automated response actions, Azure policy deployment, and learning Terraform even though [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) is my favorite.
